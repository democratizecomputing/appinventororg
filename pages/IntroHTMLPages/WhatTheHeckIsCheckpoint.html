                Losing your work to a system error needs to only happen once before one becomes more vigilant about saving work or creating a backup. When creating apps in App Inventor, it is easy to forget to “save” because the platform does it for you (every 5-30 seconds). In theory, there is no need to save a project that is already being saved. But, in reality, one should save.
			</p>

            <p>
                Given that advice, what are the App Inventor saving options?
			</p>

            <p>
                You can save projects in App inventor and to your computer. All of the options are under the Projects Menu (in both the Designer and Blocks Editor). You will find <strong>Save project</strong>, <strong>Save project as…</strong>, and <strong>Checkpoint</strong> along with <strong>Export selected project (.aia) to my computer</strong> and <strong>Export all projects</strong>.

			<h2>Save and Saves As...</h2>
            <p>
				<strong>Save project</strong> is the manual version of the automatic save feature. It merely reassures you that your project is saved and you continue working in the same version of your project. Use <strong>Save project</strong> for peace of mind.
            </p>

            <p>
				<strong>Save project as…</strong> works similarly to a Save As in Microsoft Word. It allows you to save the project with a different name and afterwards, begin working in the new version of the project. Your previous version is saved in <strong>My Projects</strong>. Use <strong>Save project as…</strong> for peace of mind.
            </p>

			<h2>Checkpoint</h2>
			<p>
                <strong>Checkpoint</strong> also makes a copy of your current project, but allows you to keep working in the original project. Creating a Checkpoint, essentially takes a snapshot of your project at a point in its development and saves it in <strong>My Projects</strong>. You may want to create many Checkpoints along the course of building your app as it grows in complexity. For example, if you create a Checkpoint before you add a database then encounter a problem or a bug that you are not sure how to fix, you can always re-open the Checkpoint that did not contain the database and start anew.
			</p>

            <p>
                When you create a new Checkpoint, App Inventor shows you a list of previous Checkpoints and the time/date they were saved.
            </p>

			">
			<p>
                Once you have completed your app, you always have the option to delete or keep your Checkpoints. Use <strong>Checkpoint</strong> for peace of mind.
            </p>

			<h2>Export</h2>
			<p>
				In addition to saving your projects within the App Inventor platform, you can also export your projects.
			</p>

            <p>
				<strong>Export selected project (.aia) to my computer</strong> is another recommended feature. It’s easy to save an .aia file to a location on your computer and/or to an online storage system like Google Docs or Dropbox. And if you ever need to open that .aia file, just select <strong>Import project (.aia) from my computer…</strong> to bring it into your projects list in App Inventor. Use <strong>Export selected project (.aia) to my computer</strong> for peace of mind.
			</p>

            <p>
				Tip of the day: For complete peace of mind, save your work within App Inventor and export your work to your computer.
